# PSX-style Horror Game Project
This is a simple PSX-style horror game I created to improve my skills.
In this game, you navigate through a maze to find 8 pieces of paper that continuously appear at different locations. Once you collect all 8 pieces, you win.

There are four different AIs in the game. One attacks you if you stay in a designated area for a certain number of seconds. Another one attacks if you enter its room with your flashlight on. The third AI becomes aggressive when you look at it once, and if you don't keep looking at it, it chases and kills you when it catches you. The last AI roams randomly between predetermined areas in a maze. If the player gets too close, it attacks, but if the player manages to escape, it resumes wandering.
